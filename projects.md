WallPaint Live Wallpaper
------------------------
My very first android app is finally live! It lets you set a plain wallpaper which is perfect for minimalists. The colors are carefully chosen so that your homescreen remains legible. It's not a big deal app, but certainly makes me happy!

Check it out here: [Android WallPaint Live Wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metasimple.android.wallpaint)

<br/>image.vim
---------
I don't believe much in God, but Vim. Here's a vim plugin I built which let's you view images in vim, yes images.
Go Vim!

<br/>boat
----
I finally own a boat!

boat let's you transfer files instantly over HTTP. It's a tiny Python tool that spawns transient HTTP web servers to serve files and they shutdown automagically. Perfect to boat some files between phones and computers, because it can generate a handy QR code!

boat is on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boat) and on [Github](https://github.com/ashisha/boat) ofcourse

<br/>shuttle
-------
Ubuntu days!

shuttle let's you quickly ssh by parsing through your ssh config. Simple and easy!
