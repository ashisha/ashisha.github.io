* I'm Ashish Anand.
* A programmer by profession, a programmer by choice.
* I write scary backend code in day time and love to ship tiny projects in my free time. UX fascinates me a lot - the connection between machines and humans, which makes people fall in love with the machines.
* Check out the [stuff I built](/ashish/projects/)
* Other than that, I sketch and [click](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ashishanandphotography) in my free time.

I'm in [Bangalore](https://goo.gl/maps/P2PFix2sbbE2) right now and loving it!
